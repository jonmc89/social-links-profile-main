## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To try and develope the solution from a Mobile-first workflow, it made it alot faster to ensure that it would be compatible with smaller screens scaling to desktop.

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 479px) {
  .card {
    width: 90%;
    height: 555px;
  }
}
```
